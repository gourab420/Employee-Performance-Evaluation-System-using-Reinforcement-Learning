# Employee Performance Evaluation System using Reinforcement Learning

An intelligent employee performance evaluation system powered by Deep Q-Learning that learns from attendance data and human feedback to predict employee performance levels.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: Deep Q-Network (DQN) that evaluates employee performance
- **Automated Data Processing**: Analyzes work hours, punctuality, and consistency metrics
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves predictions through human feedback loop
- **ersistent Model**: Saves and loads trained models automatically
- **Real-time Evaluation**: Interactive CLI for instant employee assessment
- **Incremental Training**: Learns from corrections without starting from scratch

 **In this project i use multiple dummydataset you can change it with your orginal one**
